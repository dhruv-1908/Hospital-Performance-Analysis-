# Hospital-Performance-Analysis-
The hospital performance dashboard gives an overall picture of the quality of care, ownership models, and  local discrepancies in the delivery of medical services. This analysis of some states was conducted using  Tableau to identify trends in mortality, safety of care, patient experience, and the type of hospital  ownership. 
Reflection on Skills Development and Industry Relevance 
Throughout this assignment, we significantly expanded our Tableau skillset by 
moving beyond basic chart creation into advanced analytical techniques that are highly 
relevant to healthcare data analytics. Working with the hospital dataset and extending it 
through blending with additional sources required us to think carefully about how to connect 
disparate data points into a cohesive and meaningful analysis. This experience mirrors the 
complexity of real-world health analytics, where patient outcomes, operational costs, staffing 
ratios, and quality metrics must be synthesized to support decision-making. 
One of the most impactful skills we developed was data blending. By combining the 
core hospital information dataset with supplementary data, we were able to enrich the 
analysis and uncover deeper insights. For example, blending staff-to-patient ratios allowed 
for a more nuanced understanding of hospital performance, making it possible to evaluate 
how resource allocation might correlate with outcomes such as patient safety or timeliness of 
care. In practice, healthcare analysts frequently face the challenge of working with multiple, 
siloed data sources. Developing confidence in blending has prepared us to tackle these 
scenarios and ensure that insights are not drawn in isolation. 
Another key area of growth was our use of Level of Detail (LOD) expressions. LODs 
provided a powerful way to analyze metrics at different levels of granularity, such as 
calculating average scores by state while still retaining hospital-level detail. This skill is vital 
for healthcare analytics, where policymakers often require both national-level trends and 
local insights to guide interventions. By mastering LODs, we gained the ability to flexibly 
tailor analysis depending on the audience—whether a hospital executive focused on a single 
facility or a regulator assessing system-wide performance. 

We also explored the use of interactive dashboards, incorporating visualizations such 
as scatter plots to compare hospital ratings with timeliness of care, and KPI panels to 
highlight performance against national benchmarks. Interactivity is not just a design choice; it 
is a critical skill for healthcare analytics professionals. Executives and clinicians must be able 
to manipulate dashboards to explore scenarios, identify patterns, and drill down into areas of 
concern. Although there is room for improvement in creating more parameter-driven 
interactivity, we now recognize how important it is to design with the end-user in mind. 
Perhaps the most career-relevant skill we touched on was forecasting. In healthcare, 
predictive insights are essential for anticipating patient volumes, resource needs, and outcome 
improvements. This project showed us how forecasting can move analytics from descriptive 
(“what happened”) to prescriptive (“what should we do next”). The initial attempt to perform 
a forecasting model, however, was unsuccessful due to the lack of sufficient time series data 
in the combined dataset. While the data blending process did provide a Quarter field, the 
granularity and length of the data series were not sufficient for Tableau's forecasting model to 
function. This experience was a valuable lesson in the practical limitations of data and the 
importance of data quality for predictive analytics. 
Overall, this assignment helped us connect classroom techniques to the expectations 
of a healthcare data analyst role. Employers increasingly expect proficiency in Tableau, not 
only for visualization but also for advanced analytics such as blending, LODs, and 
forecasting. Beyond technical skills, we also developed a deeper appreciation for the impact 
of analytics in healthcare: the ability to improve patient outcomes, optimize staffing, and 
support evidence-based policymaking. The work reinforced that our role as analysts is not 
just about producing dashboards—it is about enabling better decisions in a field where those 
decisions truly matter.
